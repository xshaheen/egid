# EGID Project

We all know the benefit of technology, the power of it, and we in very fast world and every millisecond make a difference. Our goal is to help take the first step toward electronic government by building an a digital identity and signature system that provide confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.

## How

- Change the national Id card with a new smart Id-card "EGID".

- EID-card will provide electronic identity operates on the basis of a public key infrastructure (PKI). All operations (authentication, signing, and decryption) will be PIN-protected (using PIN1, PIN2, PUK model).

- On top of this we can build an an efficient and secure electronic ecosystem that saves time and money. Lets get things done faster, easier and cheaper!

-- You can find more information about the project architecture and how it work [here](docs/architecture.md).
